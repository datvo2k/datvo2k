# Hey there, I'm Brian Vo! 👋

## About Me 🚀
I'm a DevOps Engineer with a knack for automating everything that moves. If it can't be automated, is it even worth doing? I've spent 2 years turning coffee into infrastructure code and believe me, it's been a wild ride!

## Skills 🛠️
- **Helm Charts**: I can whip up a Helm chart faster than you can say "Kubernetes". Packaging applications, managing releases, handling dependencies - you name it, I've charted it.
- **Prometheus Ecosystem**: I've spent so much time with Prometheus and Grafana, I see metric graphs in my dreams. I can write PromQL queries like Shakespeare wrote sonnets.
- **Terraform**: Terraform and I are like two peas in a pod. I've written so many .tf files, I sometimes start my grocery lists with `resource "apple" "granny_smith" {}`.
- **AWS**: I've tamed the beast that is AWS. EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, VPC, EKS - they're all tools in my utility belt.
- **GitOps**: I've mastered the art of GitOps, using Git as a 'single source of truth' for declarative infrastructure and applications. I'm experienced in automating deployments and ensuring consistency across environments using GitOps principles.
- **ChatOps**: I'm proficient in implementing ChatOps to streamline communication and command execution across teams. I've set up interactive chatbots that can deploy code, monitor services, and even order pizza for late-night coding sessions!
