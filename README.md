# 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗼! 𝗜'𝗺 Brian Vo

I ❤️ DevSecOps!

As a Junior DevOps Engineer, my objective is to
design and implement automated CI/CD pipelines
that comply with all security standards and include
disaster recovery plans. My main goal is to minimize
costs for the business while ensuring that products
are delivered to users as quickly as possible. I am
excited to contribute my skills and knowledge to a
dynamic team and continue to grow as a DevOps
professional.
